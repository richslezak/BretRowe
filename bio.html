      <h2 class="title">About The Artist</h2>
      <p>Rowe grew up in San Francisco's Bay Area, where the graphic
        revolution of the late 1960s fanned the flames of his creativity.
        After graduating from Arizona State University with a B.S. in
        Finance, Rowe followed his passion and established a commercial
        design firm specializing in commercial art, branding, and fine art.</p>

      <p>Having painted since his youth, Rowe made silkscreen his medium
        in the early 1990s. The artist has been showing his work at public
        and private exhibits since 1996, putting his pieces in the hands of
        collectors worldwide, including some of Hollywood's elite. Rowe's
        art can be found in the homes of actor Jack Nicholson, 'Terminator
        3' Producer Nigel Sinclair, and Guess? Jeans founder Georges
        Marciano, who commissioned Rowe to paint 24 portraits for home
        and office. The artist's text-based work also hangs in the homes of
        various screenwriters, television writers and sitcom strategists.</p>

      <p>Among collectors of Rowe's work are rock headliner Kid Rock, Evil
        Entertainment Management co-founder Eric Grzybowski, and the
        private collection of the world-renowned Canyon Ranch Spa.
        Hilton/Doubletree's 'The Wit' hotel brand also adorns the walls of
        its suites with reproductions of Rowe's artwork.</p>

      <p>A large portion of Rowe's body of work stems from private commissions and portraiture, wherein Rowe uses an
        amalgam of his writer's psyche, painter's palette, and mementos from the subject's life to deliver detailed,
        narrative 'legacy'paintings that become instant heirlooms. See a sample of this in Rowe's 'Abolitionistory.'</p>

      <p>The artist called Santa Monica, California 'home' and, with his wife Margaret, a jewelry designer, and son
        Chase, found summertime inspiration in the people, beauty, and diversity of Southern
        California and Manhattan, NYC.</p>
