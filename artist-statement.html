      <p>Our world is a constantly evolving mass of new information that
        demands unbiased interpretations, whether viewed at present or
        historically. Images, labels, castes, and religiopolitical undercurrents
        define and redefine snapshots of our culture and are framed as
        'history' seconds after occurring.</p>

      <p>The fascination borne by the characters, coincidences, and
        confounding events that connect our society is the dominant
        ingredient in my two- and three-dimensional work.</p>

      <p>For each of my narratives, I strive to create a graphic, text-driven
        composition merging these cultural snapshots with a writer's psyche and painter's palette to yield colorful
        commentary on the politicos, protagonists, performers, prima donnas, and peculiarities that
        continue to shape our planet.</p>

      <p>Having spent impressionable years of youth amid a literary family
        in a California city by the sea defined by free love, flower children,
        racial polarity, mind-blowing graphics, and a gravitating, post-
        Vietnam fascination with television as the 'it' moment news machine, I've found a graphic yet literary solution
        is the most satisfying way to me to interpret subjects that confound me.
        Theatre posters, gameboards, comics, carnival posters, and product
        packaging serve as both a resource and vehicle for my commentary
        and allow me to combine soft, vintage romanticism with
        contemporary realism.</p>

      <p>Through each of my narratives, I intend to offer an unbiased interpretation of a subject using the facts of
        choice. From the elements presented, those looking into my window on the world can create their own
        interpretation.</p>

      <p>As an eternal optimist, I believe colorful, playful images that evoke
        reflection and emotion are captured in one's mind's eye throughout life and can be paramount in maintaining a
        child-like, optimistic lens on the worldâ€”however beautiful yet bruised our world may be at any given moment. In
        turn, I believe many 'optimistic lenses' can spread hope and positively change our
        world.</p>
